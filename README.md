# Projects
This repository contains the projects I worked on in the past years.

# HTML & CSS

- Travello - This is an in-progress website I made for a traveling app for finding places, getting tickets, and finding guides to help you with your travels. The UI for this is designed to fit a modern aesthetic and be visually pleasing.

# JavaScript

- Tic Tac Toe - This is a 2 Player Tic Tac Toe website I made using JavaScript. It has a minimalistic design in order to make the gameplay the main center of focus. The gameplay itself is the same as the general Tic Tac Toe game.

# Figma - UI/UX Design

This app is still in progress and currently being worked on.
